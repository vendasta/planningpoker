# Planning Poker

Planning Poker is a technique used in agile software development to estimate the effort required to complete a task or a project. It involves a team of people who collectively estimate the amount of work required for a given task or project.

Here's how Planning Poker works:

- A facilitator presents the task or project to the team.
- Each team member is given a set of cards, usually numbered from 0 to 100 or higher.
- The team member who is most familiar with the task or project provides a brief description of what needs to be done.
- Each team member privately selects a card from their set of cards to represent the effort required to complete the task. They should not share their card with the rest of the team.
- When everyone has made their selection, all the cards are revealed simultaneously.
- The team members then discuss the reasons behind their estimates and work to come to a consensus estimate.
- If there is a large discrepancy in the estimates, the team discusses the reasons behind the discrepancy and may choose to re-estimate the task or project.
- The process is repeated until the team agrees on a final estimate.

Planning Poker is a valuable tool for agile teams because it encourages collaboration and discussion, and it helps to eliminate bias in the estimation process. It also ensures that all team members have a say in the estimation process, which leads to more accurate estimates.

# Your Task

Given the following API's your task is to build a frontend for the planning poker session. Feel free to work in teams and use any language of your choice! Note, that you should feel comfortable using tools like Chat GPT!


# Example Prompt

We are building a frontend for a planning poker game. Build an angular component that can create a new session and display the session id for others to join. 
The token returned will be used to authorize future requests for the participant. The server url to create the session is `/session/create`

The api expects the following json payload:
```json
{ 'participant_id': 'Dale Hopkins'}
```

The api response be a json object with the following structure:

```json
{
'session_id': '1234',
'token': 'opaque access token for Dale'
}
```

# Available Votes
The following votes will be used within the planning session game. 

`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, `8`, `13`, `20`, `40`, `100`, `?`, `☕️`

# Sample Backend / Frontend
There are two backend sample applications. Both are implementations of the same api. They were written in a code off, one implemented by hand and one written using chat GPT.
The frontend is a simple angular application that again was generated by chat GPT.

Notes:
- session storage is persisted only in memory
- no cookies are being used, meaning that the tokens are not persisted across browser sessions
- the frontend application was not meant to be a robust application, it was meant to be a simple example of how to use the api
